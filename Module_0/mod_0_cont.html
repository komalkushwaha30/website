                        than dividend) :-</h3>
                    <p> Long division is a method used to divide numbers, including decimals. When dividing by a
                        decimal, move the decimal point in both the divisor and dividend to align them. Then proceed
                        with the division as usual, placing the decimal point in the quotient above the original decimal
                        position.</p>

                            expressions involving multiple operators. Each letter represents a specific operation:
                            (i) B: Brackets (Numbers inside brackets are evaluated first).<br>
                            (ii) O: Orders (Refers to powers or roots, such as exponents or indices).<br>

                    <p>Algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with symbolic representation and the
                        manipulation of mathematical expressions. It introduces variables (like x, y, and z) and extends
                        arithmetic beyond basic addition and multiplication. In algebra, we use equations to express
                        relationships between quantities, solve unknowns, and analyze patterns. From solving elementary
                        equations to exploring abstract concepts, algebra plays a crucial role in various fields.
                        Whether you’re finding the volume of a container or calculating bank interest, algebra provides
                        the tools to express and solve mathematical problems.</p>

                    <p> (i) Natural Numbers: Natural numbers are the positive integers we encounter while counting. They
                        start from 1 and continue indefinitely: 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.<br>
                        (ii) Even Numbers: Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2. Their unit place digits
                        can be
                        0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Examples include 8, 14, and 50.<br>
                        (iii) Odd Numbers: Unlike even numbers, odd numbers are not divisible by 2. They have 1, 3, 5,
                        7, or 9
                        at their unit place. Examples include 13, 21, and 65.<br>
                        (iv) Prime Numbers: Prime numbers have exactly two factors: 1 and the number itself. Examples
                        include
                        2, 3, 5, and 7. Every prime number is odd except for the number 2.<br>
                        (v) Composite Numbers: Composite numbers are non-prime natural numbers. They have more than two
                        factors. For instance, 4, 6, and 9 are composite numbers.</p>

                    <p>(i) HCF (Highest Common Factor):
                        The HCF, also known as the greatest common factor (GCF), represents the largest positive integer
                        that divides two or more numbers without leaving a remainder.
                        For example, consider the numbers 8 and 12. The H.C.F. of 8 and 12 is 4 because it’s the highest
                        number that can divide both 8 and 12 evenly.<br>
                        (ii)LCM (Least Common Multiple):
                        The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by two or more given numbers.
                        For instance, let’s take the positive integers 4 and 6. The common multiples for 4 and 6 are 12,
                        24, 36, and so on. The least common multiple among these is 12.
                        To find the LCM of any two numbers, we can use methods like prime factorization or division.

                    <p>Factorization involves expressing a given algebraic expression as a product of its factors. These
                        factors can be numbers, variables, or other algebraic expressions. The process of factorization
                        simplifies expressions, helps solve equations, and aids in understanding mathematical
                        relationships. For instance, consider the quadratic expression (x^2 - 4). It can be factorized
                        as ((x - 2)(x + 2)), where both ((x - 2)) and ((x + 2)) are factors. </p>

                    <p>(i) Quadratic Equation:
                        A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree two.
                        It takes the form: (ax^2 + bx + c = 0), where (a), (b), and (c) are constants, and (x)
                        represents the variable.
                        Quadratic equations often arise in problems related to motion, geometry, and science.<br>
                        (ii) Roots of a Quadratic Equation:
                        The roots of a quadratic equation are the values of (x) that satisfy the equation, making it
                        equal to zero.
                        These roots can be found using various methods:
                        Factoring: Factor the quadratic expression and set each factor equal to zero.
                        Quadratic Formula: Use the formula: (x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{{2a}}).
                        Completing the Square: Transform the equation into a perfect square trinomial.
                        Graphing: Locate the x-intercepts on a graph.
                        Example:
                        Consider the quadratic equation: (x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0).
                        By factoring, we find the roots: (x = 2) and (x = 5), as they satisfy the equation.

                    <h3 id="log">8. Logarithm & exponentiation :- </h3>
                    <p>(i)Logarithms:
                        Logarithms are the inverse of exponentiation. They provide a different way to express exponents.
                        Given a base (b) and a number (x), the logarithm of (x) to the base (b) is the exponent to which
                        (b) must be raised to yield (x).<br>
                        For example:
                        If (10^2 = 100), then (\log_{10} 100 = 2).<br>
                        In general, (\log_b x = n) means (b^n = x).<br>
                        Logarithms help simplify large numbers and have applications in various fields.<br>
                        (ii)Exponentiation:
                        Exponentiation involves raising a base number to a certain power (exponent).<br>
                        For instance:
                        (2^3 = 8) (2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8).
                        Exponents allow us to express repeated multiplication efficiently.
                        Logarithms and exponentiation are closely related: logarithms tell us how many times a base must
                        be multiplied to get a specific number, while exponentiation represents the process of repeated
                        multiplication.
